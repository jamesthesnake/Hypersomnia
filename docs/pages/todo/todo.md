- arbitrary upscaling (only UI left)
    - verdict: use zoom on gameplay, let's render GUI to a separate fbo and stretch it

    - as for the game literally nothing else is required except zoom=2

    - will partially solve the resolution advantage problem
    - note that we'll have to adjust UI positions too, just zooming in won't do
        - fastest will be to stretch it with an fbo, as we won't have to rebuild ui fonts
        - do we really have to use an fbo though if we already virtually render it in 1920x1080?
        - what about mouse position?
    - will have to first scale the get_window_size value

- Fist fighting could work by spawning an invisible fist melee item but only during attack
	- What if we have an invisible item without space etc that is only visible to melee system and drawer?
		- but you also need to infer collider or no?

- Default spawn generation for FFA-like modes
    - later, GunGame will be team-based

- The "Race" mode for surf maps could count how fast someone entered the final portal
	- E.g. 12000 entering velocity = +12 score, 1000 velocity = +1 score etc
	- This way players could compete within a single loop

- reverb area

- Do not hold name map in solvable
    - Pointless to sync over the network
    - serves no purpose logic-side as entity ids can serve identification
    - Only callouts should have it
        - however callouts can just have a flavour allocated
    - Alright maybe specific_names will come in handy
        - Right now it's only used to map entity ids to nicknames
        - But we shouldn't draw it like that
        - Yeah but let's leave it like that for now, no time for this

- black stroke for stamina/health circular bars because they're invisible on brighter maps

- Show a tooltip with some basic info when hovering resources in filesystem view like the initial size e.g. 32x64
	- length for sounds etc

- Melee clash should: a) happen more often; b) and cancel damage

- Merging static colliders
	- Purpose
		- Performance: Less overhead for visibility system
			- Although lights filter duplicate vertices, there would still be less raycasts if bodies were merged
		- Physics precision: a wall-touching character will always hit the edges between two bodies, pretty annoying
			- Weren't much of a problem until now so it won't be important until next MVP I guess

	- Instead of a full-blown geometry editor, let's auto-detect static colliders with identical materials that touch each other
		- When should it be done?
			- We thought of post-inference in the cosmos but you have no guarantee that some constituent entities won't be reinferred on their own for some reason (e.g. there could be some script)
			- Therefore it should be done on Editor->Cosmos conversion stage
				- There we have more civilised ways of determining whether two nodes can be truly merged
	- and then let the user compose complex shapes with just the primitives they come up with
		- That way we don't force precise geometry editing on the mapper
		- and this is even easier on the mapper


- Enter while filtering with ImGuiTextFilter could always select the target
	- E.g. go to node on scene
	- But leave this for later as it might be too automatic of a behavior
		- We never even used this filtering field before, people will just click on scene mostly

- We might need to rework the lights to use two radiuses
	- But once we're able to recreate cyberaqua etc
	- Yeah I think a total rework for the light system will be necessary
- There's no point making workarounds now because we'll replace it with two 50%/100% falloff parameters
	- and this will solve pretty much everything
- We'll just tell people to place lights without changing defaults
	- Except for radius because it can stay like this
	- We might add half_radius too
		- More intuitive than 50%_falloff and anyways we cant put % in the prop name
- Yeah for now let's just disable editing of attenuations altogether
	- Maybe we'll even end up with just this model
	- The rest works nicely, it's only important that we can edit radius
		- and cutoff alpha for rudimentary "intensity" scaling

- Make throwing headshots more consistent by considering e.g. the center of the rattle, the velocity of the rattle and head center
	- Actually not the center of the rattle
		- Whenever a bullet/thrown item is spawned, register current trajectory
			- Except for homing missiles, not sure how headshots should be handled here, the old way could work
				- Actually it could work - if it's homing (so changed trajectory) never register the headshot, only on direct hit
	- All headshot/ricochet detection will benefit from it because there's no measure that is more accurate
		- Except for ricochets on the homing missiles, we should calculate it by the current velocity etc
			- Even though realistically once it starts to "home" there won't be any ricochets remaining

	- On ricochet, we'll just have to update the trajectory
- Entity types to add later once we won't break abi
	- CALLOUT WITH ITS NAME IN THE COMPONENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	- Plain sprited bodies but with arbitrary polygons per-entity, obviously
	- Dynamic decorations but non-organism like, we should have a specific entity for an organism
		- Pointless for them to be processed just like static animations

- Filters window
	- Visible
		- (Checkboxes) Backgrounds Physical Foregrounds
	- Selectable
		- (Checkboxes) Backgrounds Physical Foregrounds

- When resizing, might be a good idea to determine edges based on total aabb of selected entities

- honor playtesting spawns
- stronger highlight for icons? hover/activated is almost invisible

- Grenades could/should have very low restitution against player bodies
- Laser should switch to the knife/grenade being thrown when it is done with a gun in another hand
	- Actually just disable the second laser then because there are both now

## Editor final MVP (post MVP) once we can ditch old maps

- Deprecate ruleset maps.
    - Rebuild arena when changing mode
	- This will be necessary anyway with modes that can alter rebuild behavior (like enabling destroyed environments for zombie mode)
    - Then pick only one mode

- remove fy_minilab_reloaded-only clause from project selector where it's scanning for official areas

- Ensure all official floors have *some* footsteps set

- Full illumination maybe per entity too for foregrounds
    - Otherwise we'd need two types of ferns because cyberaqua has a full illumination one

- wtf, warmup_theme shouldn't be a flavour id but a sound effect input
	- It actually needs to be a flavor because it's synchronized through the network so it needs to be an entity
		- it can't be a sound effect
	- However later we'll just allow sound decorations to be entities, pointless to have invariants here (?)
		- Remember it's sent through the network in that case, although it's just a few bytes
	- We'll need to entitize at least gain and pitch to be able to honor these modifiers in sound node and theme properties
		- Well, fortunately we'll easily be able to do this

- search for TODO in editor generally

- Markers should have letters per-entity just like factions
	- we can only set them per-invariant right now, there are bombsite_dummy_b etc, this is bad obv

- Renames for weapons!!! We should really decide once and for all about some names so that they're future-proof
	- Best to avoid two-word names except in rare cases
	- We can use some polish names because they'll be sounding interesting to foreign players
	- elon_hrl -> rocket_launcher (we though
		- Good PR because it's then obvious to anyone new to the game
		- Warx fq12 -> warx (there's no other single-word intuitive name for an automatic shotgun)
		- datum_gun -> datum
		- ao44 -> revolver
			- actually let's leave it at ao44 because we'll use "Revolver" for something stronger
		- hpsr -> awka
		- lewsII -> lews (there's no I anyway)
		- amplifier_arm -> amplifier
	

- Sounds should have per-entity sound effect modifiers (we implement it in editor already)

- Resizing animations

- Watch out for MAX_IMAGES_IN_INTERCOSM
	- Let's not allocate this statically


- Check what happens when we overflow the texture size
	- with some giant gif for example
	- we can later implement the optimizations like separating atlases

- AIR_DUCT -> VENT in official resources
	- We can't do it now because it's gonna break maps

- Let's make sprite's special effect a boolset
	- and not just have one effect speed multiplier
	- for now one will just implicitly override another

- Move render invariant to component, instead of allocating flavors for each override
	- WE STILL NEED AN OVERRIDE FOR physical->non physical.
	- Entire render component could fit into two bytes
	- Will even be faster to calculate render layer because won't have to refer to flavor
	- When we componentize render, we can still have editable defaults in the resource

## Others


- Reset properties to default under Right-click 
	- Could be easy but arguably not needed right now
	- Most of node properties won't have the concept of default
	- Resources, maybe, still they have the reset button so one can always check and undo

- Review the TODO: comments especially inside editor sources once we're close to MVP

- Atlas
	- FIRST into neon maps and diffuse 
	- Literally even neons have separate drawcalls for foreground, dropped items and 
	- Then trivially separate into items/background stuffs/foreground stuffs
		- Since we know these will always be drawcalled separately
		- We control rendering, it's not like unity so we should really be good to go
	- And boom you have tripled the amount of textures we can contain

- Equip z prawej w jak w ceesie najlepiej
	- equip load pasek bardzo widoczny nad wszystkimi slotami

- W winter stories czy czym≈õ takim elementem gameplayu jak nie masz ammo jest rzucanie melee i zbieranie z pod≈Çogi z powrotem
	- jak w duelach

- More camera modes for Spectator

- Multiple official servers
	- Picking best
	- Do this once we have pinging implemented, which we want with the list of community servers

- Consider a tab for "official" and "community" in browse servers
	- Actually maybe no because it'd be nice to have it condensed and compare best pings quickly
- "Favorites" tab

- Quick play
	- From servers that have any players, find the one with best latency

- Make server save RCON changes to the config

- Inventory improvements
	- When a melee weapon is involved in akimbo, pressing its corresponding button results in a throw
	- When two melee weapons are wielded, pressing its button results in both thrown at once

- "Are you sure you want to quit?" from the ingame main menu

- fix vim's premature build successful
- implement a keycombo to dump and open current logs (multiple clients)

- Nerf PRO90
	- less bullets please

- Make the bomb a lot lighter
- Fix bomb planted reward
- Game Guides
- Recon grenade

- We have to renew that certificate or people will be unable to update the game
	- somehow it still works
	- as it's done over ssl

- Randomized tips
	- Stay still to regenerate stamina faster.
	- Double-tap R to drop the old mag for a faster reload. Near-empty mags are dropped automatically.
	- Melee blows are stronger when you run.
	- Electric Shield lets you live longer, but slows down your movement.

- Config folder with delta configs
	- like in linux
	- sorted by filenames

- It would be nice if we didn't crash on loading a corrupted map, at least if we manage to hit an ensure before sigsegv

- Pulse "your own" color for a funny effect

- Fix owner tracking for grenades as they get deleted and the death summary can't know whose that grenade really was

- Sounds for grenade throwing 
	- Flashbang out
	- Throwing frag
	- Frag out
	- EMP
	- Interference!
- maybe don't save the last launch unless in debug

- problem: footstep smokes might still be visible when we artificially increase zoom
	- well the client itself knows everything anyways
	- so we can force the zoom to be exact
		- if someone has more than 1920x1080 they technically have the advantage but the footsteps would still be hearable
			- one could still see some distant items thrown but come on

- ImGui popup for progress on loading atlases
	- the imgui atlas itself will load quickly enough

- Initial popup about the zoom change
	- or scale automatically to the server's fog of war size?

- Consider implementing a radius range for item pickups

- Shouldn't we always calc reloading movement to show context-lessly?


- Force proper drawing order of attachments as this really looks bad on the rocket launcher
	- At least on guns?

- Lag estimates for other players
	- send a byte for count, and a byte for each player
		- they can be consecutive and we don't have to include ids
		- the order of existent ids implicitly known
	- can be sent over the solvable stream
		- later we could introduce advantages for players with higher ping, although may not necessarily be good idea

- Detect when the initial state is being sent to optionally display progress
	- Possibly by returning some info from ReceiveBlockData struct

- Properly implement bots
	- Now they can break the client logic

- large block sending augs api
	- asynchronous: deliver_large_data
	- large_data_delivered() const
	- always one large data is sent at a time

- enum-less variants of enum_boolset and enum_map
	- useful for quick mapping users in an array

- So that we can change tickrate dynamically, timing logic can, instead of steps, simply hold the floating point (double) values of the seconds passed
	- alternatively hold unsigned long longs?
	- also store last_fixed_delta for easy cosmos::get_fixed_delta access

- Usability fixes to editor 
	- Setting specific names to entities
	- Complex instantiations
		- I struggle to see any that are necessary before DM
			- even manual transfers arent that necessary
		- Guns with magazines already
		- For now expose transfer GUI?

- enum_boolset begin and end should probably return enums
	- simpler lua i/o
	- no need for for-eaches
	- nice exercise for iterators

- When joining a game, allow choosing the flavour of the character
	- Each might have completely different properties or animations
	- Effectively implements a class

- Arbitrary pasting of entities
	- Vastly useful for importing stuff from testbed maps into existing ones
		- Let alone between community maps
	- This is pretty complex.
		- If we allow pasting across workspaces, we might even have to copy actual asset files.
	- Won't matter until after deathmatch stage
		- Surely?
	- The editor will have to construct the command tree, like
		- paste_flavours + paste_entities, if no requisite flavours are found inside the project at the time of pasting
			- the clipboard will have both the entity and flavour
		- the editor's clipboard can actually become...
			- paste entity flavour + paste entity command, stored, waiting to be executed!
				- the move itself won't need to be stored
	- Cut is just copy + delete

- Allow to change the tickrate in the non-playtesting?
	- This will be a session setting, really
	- We'll just restart on re-tick

- Overwrite notice in editor

- Refactor: conditional log macro

- Always initialize the hotbar with some values if it is not yet initialized

- Commands refactor: separation of undo and redo state
	- redoer and undoer objects
		- each has only the required information
		- redoer returns an undoer
		- redo state is always the same

- Balance colliding bullets so that damage to be dealt is subtracted from the stronger bullet
	- Possibly reduce trace size then

- Local setup should record session live
	- This is really important in the face of bugs.
	- Or just get rid of test scene setup for now and let it by default launch a scene in editor that records inputs

- Fix rendering order of dropped gun attachments
	- Also make it possible to always render them under?

- consider having entity guids in components instead of entity ids for simplicity of network transfers
	- question is, won't we anyway be sending the whole pool state?
		- it's just several bytes overhead per entity
	- there ain't really that many and it will be greatly useful

- Fill new workspace with test scene essentials
	- This would prevent image ids in common state from being invalid
		- Probably less checks to make, in GUI as well
	- Can make those the first in test scene image enums so that we can stop importing images after some point

- copy gfx and sfx folders on save as...

- let particle definitions be split into the invariant and variant parts, like components
	- pro: better cache coherency

- templatize some dangling memory stream arguments

- in go to dialog, make selection groups appear as the first
	- later we might just make a variant of several types instead of entity_guid in match vector

- fix saving of the editor view state when the work is saved to some non-untitled location
	- notice that, we might later introduce some caches for selections to improve performance
		- e.g. only always calculate the selection's aabb and rotation centers once
	- we might also want to encapsulate setting panning cameras and selections to have stacks
		- where we'll able to set modification flags easily
	- **therefore let's do it when we get to these stacks.**
		- because camera & selection state isn't all that critical
			- and untitled work for testing is always saved anyway
	- we can just always write the camera to disk?
		- it's bad though as it incurs disk activity every time
		- and selection state isn't that small
	- we could either set an "is_modified" flag or track it in history
		- not much modification points for selections, so quite viable

- pass display size and implement augs::get_display

- some hint for windows unicode in imgui: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1060

- finish work with atlas and sound regeneration
	- regenerate only seen assets
	- always load diffuse map with the corresponding neon map to avoid unilluminated objects near the camera...
		- ...even though many diffuse maps nearby have been loaded
		- perhaps we won't really need the separation between diffuse and neon, because maximum atlases will be huge anyway

- Shake on shooting with a sniper rifle

- Dashing
	- Assigned to space, since we don't have jumping anyway
	- pure color highlight system could be used to add highlight the dashing entity
	- Gradually increase walking force over time
	- The more the speed during dash, the stronger the dash

- Note: drone sound (sentience sounds overall) will be calculated exactly as the firing engine sound
	- Sentience humming caches
	- These don't need their playing pos synchronized

- Since mouse motions will probably be the bottleneck of network communication, both coords will usually be able to be sent in one byte
	- Range would be 0 - 16
	- There would be a bit flag for when it exceeds the range
		- Which will actually be often and then we might use two bytes
			- mouse motion should never really exceed 255
				- will also make it harder to use aimbots that instantaneously change mouse location
